# SD WebUI Forge Neo Classic - Civitai Helper

An enhanced Civitai Helper extension for **Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge**, forked from the original [Civitai Helper](https://github.com/butaixianran/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper) with major feature upgrades inspired by [ComfyUI LoRA Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager).

## ✨ What's New (vs Original)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ⚡ **One-Click LoRA Apply** | Apply LoRA with trigger words + `<lora:name:strength>` tag to prompt in one click. Adjustable strength via slider. |
| 🔑 **Trigger Words Tooltip** | Hover over any model card to instantly see trigger words — no click needed. |
| 📦 **File Size Display** | Model card shows file size badge (e.g. `144.2 MB`). |
| 📝 **Model Notes** | Add personal notes to any model, saved as `.ch_note` file alongside the model. |
| 🔍 **Smart Scan Skip** | Models that already have info + preview are automatically skipped, dramatically reducing scan time. |
| 📊 **Real-Time Scan Progress** | Live progress bar with percentage, current model name, and step-by-step status (SHA256 / API / Preview / Skipped). |
| 🔄 **Batch Download New Versions** | Download all detected new versions at once. |
| 🗑 **Extension Uninstall Button** | Uninstall extensions directly from Forge's extension page — no manual folder deletion needed. |
| 🔄 **Force Update Button** | Force update any extension via `git reset --hard` + `git pull` — fixes update detection issues from force-pushed repos. |
| 🎯 **More Model Types** | Now supports **ControlNet**, **VAE**, **Upscaler** in addition to LoRA/TI/Hypernetwork/Checkpoint. |
| 🚀 **Performance Optimization** | Batch API requests, frontend caching, request locking — no more UI freezing with large model collections. |

## ❓ Common Issues

### Card buttons not showing
Click the 🔁 **Refresh Civitai Helper** button in the Extra Networks toolbar.

### Can't detect extension updates (after force push)
Use the 🔄 **Force Update** button on the Extensions page.

### Scan or API request failed
Civitai may be temporarily down or rate-limiting. Wait a moment and try again. If you're in China, configure a proxy in settings.

### Wrong model info from Civitai
Some models have incorrect SHA256 in Civitai's database. Use "Get Model Info by URL" to manually link your model.
